# Deep Learning for Medical Image Super-Resolution Methods and Applications

## Abstract

Digital image processing is a fundamental foundation in medical imaging technologies. The super-
resolution method has emerged as a technique that provides sustainable solutions for poor quality
and low-resolution images. Super-resolution is an algorithm-based method that upscales single or
multiple low-resolution images into high-resolution images without losing important features. It
has many applications in different fields, including satellite imaging technology, medical imaging,
and remote sensing. Using this method helps medical imaging industries avoid wasting resources
on manufacturing image acquisition devices. Additionally, the super-resolution method helps such
industries manufacture less expensive medical devices used in imaging medicine.

Therefore, throughout this study, different techniques of image processing in medical imaging,
especially the super-resolution technique, are explained in detail, along with their advantages and
applications in medical imaging operations. Moreover, the implementation of the super-resolution
method using machine learning and deep neural network technology has been discussed, including
its limitations in the field of healthcare.
